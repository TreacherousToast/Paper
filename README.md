Info about this fork
------

The purpose of this fork is to maintain a version of Paper that supports TNT duplication and possibly some other technical quirks found in the vanilla game, like 0-tick farming. When the mainline version of Paper supports enabling or disabling TNT dupers, this repository will no longer be needed.
